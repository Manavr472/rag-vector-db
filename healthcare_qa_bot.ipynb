    "# Healthcare QA Bot - Self-Ask with Search Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements a healthcare question-answering system using the **Self-Ask with Search** pattern, integrating Google Gemini API, Pinecone vector database, and Hugging Face healthcare datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Self-Ask Pattern**: Decomposes complex questions into simpler sub-questions for better understanding\n",
    "- **Healthcare Dataset Integration**: Uses Hugging Face medical datasets plus curated healthcare knowledge\n",
    "- **Conversational Handling**: Manages greetings, farewells, and general conversation\n",
    "- **Medical Safety**: Includes appropriate disclaimers and safety recommendations\n",
    "- **Search-Based Retrieval**: Vector similarity search with confidence scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Architecture\n",
    "1. **Question Analysis**: Determines if input is conversational or medical\n",
    "2. **Question Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into manageable sub-questions\n",
    "3. **Search Process**: Retrieves relevant medical information for each sub-question\n",
    "4. **Answer Synthesis**: Combines sub-answers into comprehensive response\n",
    "5. **Safety Layer**: Adds medical disclaimers and professional consultation recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Ask vs ReACT Comparison\n",
    "- **Self-Ask**: Focuses on question decomposition and iterative search\n",
    "- **ReACT**: Emphasizes reasoning, acting, and observing with tool usage\n",
    "- **Healthcare Context**: Self-Ask better suits medical Q&A where breaking down symptoms/treatments is crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Components\n",
    "- `HealthcareConfig`: System configuration for medical domain\n",
    "- `HealthcareDatasetLoader`: Loads Hugging Face medical datasets\n",
    "- `GreetingHandler`: Manages conversational interactions\n",
    "- `SelfAskSearchSystem`: Core Self-Ask implementation with search\n",
    "- `HealthcareQABot`: Main interface integrating all components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "- **Hugging Face**: Medical dialog datasets for real medical conversations\n",
    "- **Curated Knowledge**: Symptoms, treatments, emergency care, mental health\n",
    "- **Safety Guidelines**: Medication management, when to seek care\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize and use the healthcare bot\n",
    "healthcare_bot = HealthcareQABot(config, embedding_manager, self_ask_system, greeting_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ask a complex question\n",
    "result = healthcare_bot.ask(\"What are the symptoms and treatment options for diabetes?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# The bot will:\n",
    "# 1. Decompose into: [\"What are symptoms of diabetes?\", \"What are treatment options for diabetes?\"]\n",
    "# 2. Search medical knowledge for each sub-question\n",
    "# 3. Synthesize comprehensive answer with medical disclaimer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Features\n",
    "- **Question Decomposition**: Automatically breaks complex medical queries\n",
    "- **Confidence Scoring**: Relevance-based confidence metrics\n",
    "- **Source Attribution**: Tracks information sources for transparency\n",
    "- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates advanced AI techniques specifically tailored for healthcare information systems with appropriate safety measures."
